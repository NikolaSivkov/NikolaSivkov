## I'm frustrated

Over the entirety of my career, i've worked almost entirely in a SCRUM type of SDLC.



## My issues with SCRUM

Over the past few years, i've started to notice patterns across multiple companies, that have me questioning the religious zealots that are the SCRUM certified consultants on these repeating patterns, and their answers is almost always "Well, ideally...". This bugs me a lot, not because they are wrong, but because we don't live in an ideal world with perfect people, with equally perfect skills and knowledge.  

Here's some examples of the answers I get.  

### Jack of all trades, master of none

> Well, ideally, every developer should be able to do everything! Design, FE development, BE development, database development, DevOps, UX, test, do performance testing, automation, mobile development!  
> Well, ok.. maybe not everything but at least FE development, BE development, database development, DevOps & testing  
> Well, ok.. we realize there should be some specialists.. like for mobile development...

Those (almost) exact words were spoken to me by a SCRUM trainer & a senior PM.  
I couldn't help but try and hold my laughter.  
What these people don't realize is that it takes 2-4 years of learning before you can be somewhat decent programmer in ONE area. Maybe two if you're really passionate and are studying 10-14 hours a day, every day.  
Most programmers are specialist in one area for the first 5-6 years of their career, and then they start expanding more as technologies shift. And even after 10 years of experience, there's a vast amount of people that are "just" (not meant in a negative way) backend, frontend, database or mobile developers in one language and one framework. I do not know any one programmer with less than 10 years of programming, that's proficient in more than 2 programming languages and 2 frameworks, and those are usually fullstack developers. And the reason why it's this stuff is really hard to get good at.  

After my talk with the SCRUM trainer & senior PM, i got to talk to few of the developers present and almost all of them expressed concerns like "Does this mean i should start learning <<other technology i'm not familiar with >>??"

My analogy for this to the PMs and SCRUM gurus would be the following :  
> Do you want a dermatologist doing cardiology surgery, just because they're both doctors?

There's nothing more demotivating than making someone do ( in this case learn ) something they don't want to do. If they wanted to do (learn) the thing, they would've done it themselves by now.

> Well, ideally, we shouldn't get bugs if all the requirements are met.

> Well, ideally, the Business Analysts & Product Owners have written everything inside the features & stories

> Well, ideally, we should not have spillover, if the stories were estimated correctly!

Other similar statements that also bug me :  

> The whole team should estimate a story, even though either the most senior dev or the most junior dev should be able to work on it, and deliver it in the same time 

> What do you mean there was a prod bug and you were not able to finish your stories?!?!
