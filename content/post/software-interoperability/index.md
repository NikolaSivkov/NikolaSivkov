## Software, we need to talk

Hey Software, look, it's not me, it's you. I've been trying to make you talk to your friends, but you don't budge. I can't take this anymore, you need to talk to your friends and trust them somehow. I shouldn't have to spend 5 grand, just so i can come and visit you with OAuth & SSO. You have so many options in front of you, so many friends, but you don't seem to want to work together. Why is that?


## We need free OIDC, OAuth, SSO

In the current day and age of an growing open source software ecosystem, there seems to be a growing pain of those fantastic pieces of software not being able to talk to each other, well... at least if you don't pay 5 000 USD for an enterprise license. As a result, we can't build software that has common access to accounts, we can't link the data in any sensible way, and can't build on top without herculean efforts to hack around those pieces of software, and extract & transform the data to be useful elsewhere.

## Here's what i mean

How can i connect Immich or Photo Prism, with Otter Contact or Monica.  
How can i invite the same people to collaborate on etherpad without having to get them to register new account in a new system? How can i enrich and combine all the knowledge & data i have without spending weeks writing code to extract data from multiple systems?
