## Whatever happened to smartphones?

Remember when we could pop the back off of our smartphones change the SIM card, and battery in a matter of seconds?
And we still had fairly thin phones, true, not as thing today, but i will gladly give up 2-3 mm in exchange of being able to swap out my dying battery.
Oh, and we still get those 2-3 mm of thickness, since most of us put phone cases since we value money, and usually can't afford another 500$ phone for at least a year or two.

> Oh, but 500$ is not a lot for a smartphone!

You might say, but given ~~some~~ most people on the planet earn less than that per month, doesn't it make sense to not try empoverish those same people, by designing throw-away garbage

We've reached a point in the smartphone development where we're only getting diminishing returns. My 4 year old smartphone, while it doesn't have the latest CPU, or 16gb ram or 1tb of storage, still runs fine all apps that i use.

So why do we keep giving Apple, Samsung, Google and the likes money for something that's same as last years model and costs 50-100$ more each year?
We're generating metric tons of e-waste, which we could drastically reduce by even just having the option for easy battery swap.
